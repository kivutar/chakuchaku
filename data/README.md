# JLPT N5 grammar inventory

`jlpt-n5-grammar.json` is the canonical preliminary curriculum for the app. It
is deliberately a flat array: categories are labels on entries, not nested
sections. Stable `id` values can later key lessons, exercises, and user progress.

`grammar-coverage.md` is the generated flat checklist for exercise planning. A
checked bullet means at least one authored exercise meaningfully assesses that
point and records its ID; the bullet also lists every matching exercise.
Coverage measures deliberate practice, not mastery. Run `npm run content` after
editing exercises to update it rather than editing the checklist directly.

Recognition exercises must list at least two grammar points that drive their
intended translation challenge. Production exercises may isolate one grammar
point in a shorter, lower-difficulty prompt; otherwise, two to four is the
normal range. A denser exercise may retain more when every point is independently
meaningful. Incidental foundations, routine conjugation machinery, and secondary
structures are omitted. This remains an editorial step because tokenization can
identify word forms, but cannot decide what an exercise meaningfully assesses.

Exercise fields are semantic: `text` is always the displayed prompt and
`solution` is always the reference answer. Omitting `type` creates a
`recognition` exercise with a Japanese prompt and English answer. Setting
`type: "production"` creates an English prompt and Japanese answer. Content
generation still tokenizes the Japanese side for vocabulary and kanji tracking.
During local testing, `?type=production` restricts selection to production
exercises without creating a persistent setting.

Production exercises may add `promptVocabularyHints`, mapping individual
English prompt words to one or more IDs from the vocabulary dictionary. These
authored links handle ambiguous words such as `take` without duplicating
Japanese terms or readings in exercise data. The UI shows dictionary forms on
hover and leaves conjugation to the learner.

Each entry contains only scalar fields:

- `category`: a filterable curriculum area.
- `kind`: concept, form, particle, pattern, expression, structure, or system.
- `pattern`: the Japanese form or an abstract formation.
- `name`: a concise English label.
- `meaning`: the learning objective.
- `scope`: `foundation`, `core`, or `boundary`.

There is no official itemized JLPT grammar syllabus. This inventory synthesizes
the shared conversation with the official JLPT N5 test-item descriptions and
the N5 curricula published by Bunpro, JLPT Sensei, and Yatta. `boundary` keeps
useful points that sources variously place at N5 or N4 without presenting them
as undisputed N5 requirements.

Writing systems, vocabulary, and kanji are excluded because this file is the
grammar curriculum. Grammar-dependent counting, time, and question systems are
included.

## JLPT N5 conjugation curriculum

`jlpt-n5-conjugation.json` assigns 43 verbs and 79 adjectives from the shared
vocabulary inventory to an inflection class. Verbs use godan, ichidan, `する`,
or `来る`, with the `行く` て-form exception. Adjectives use regular い,
irregular `いい` (including compounds), or な. `いかが` is not treated as an
inflecting adjective, while `ない` is omitted because requesting its negative
would create an unnatural double-negative drill.

The browser combines these entries with the rules in `conjugation.js`, producing
exercises for 39 stable SRS points rather than one card per word-and-form pair:
the original 25 verb rules, ten regular adjective class/form combinations, and
four irregular `いい` transformations. The affirmative `いいです` shares the
regular `～いです` point. The list remains deliberately limited to beginner
forms; compound grammar such as `～てくれる` stays in Grammar for now.

## JLPT N5 vocabulary inventory

`jlpt-n5-vocabulary.json` is a flat synthetic vocabulary inventory. There is no
official current word list: the JLPT organizers explain that they stopped
publishing vocabulary, kanji, and grammar specifications after the 2010 revision
because the test is intended to measure communicative use rather than memorized
lists.

The inventory currently contains 826 entries:

- 718 `core` entries adapted from the MIT-licensed Open Anki JLPT N5 deck at
  commit `1ad66734417aca9dbcca6b2d5ee440cb13ab3ba0`.
- 3 `core` Katakana entries restored by comparison with the former JLPT Level 4
  vocabulary specification: `グラス`, `コピー`, and `スリッパ`.
- 1 contextual core entry, `田んぼ`, added to give the initial Kanji curriculum
  a natural complete-word exercise for `田`.
- 104 `supplemental` entries: 38 recognizable and motivating beginner words,
  29 words needed by the current lessons, and 37 words curated for practical
  Katakana coverage. These include `ラーメン`, `寿司`, `アニメ`, `漫画`,
  food, travel, culture, modern technology, and everyday loanwords.

The `core` label means "exam-oriented consensus candidate," not "officially
required." The `supplemental` label keeps useful lesson vocabulary without
inflating claims about the exam. This is why a familiar word can be retained
even when older exam-preparation lists omit it.

Each entry contains:

- `id`: a stable content-derived identifier.
- `term`: the preferred Japanese written form.
- `reading`: the kana reading, normalized to hiragana where applicable.
- `alternateReadings`: optional additional readings accepted by vocabulary recall.
- `meaning`: a concise English gloss.
- `partOfSpeech`: a broad app-friendly grammatical category.
- `scope`: `core` or `supplemental`.
- `source`: the origin of the entry.
- `audio`: an optional `assets/voices/vocab/*.m4a` pronunciation used by kana exercises.
- `voiceSlug`: required only when multiple entries have the same romanized reading;
  it adds a stable semantic suffix such as `ame-rain` or `ame-candy`.
- `variants`: optional alternative written forms.
- `inflections`: optional surface/reading pairs for tokenizer ambiguity.
- `topic`: an optional topic on curated supplemental entries.

The upstream MIT notice is retained in
`licenses/open-anki-jlpt-decks-MIT.txt`. Sources used to establish the size and
scope of the synthetic list:

- https://www.jlpt.jp/e/faq/ (no official post-2010 vocabulary specification)
- https://github.com/jamsinclair/open-anki-jlpt-decks (open N5 dataset)
- https://www.mlcjapanese.co.jp/n5_04_01.html (about 800 words; 802-item study list)
- https://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/jlpt5/ (689-word N5 study list)

`katakana-vocabulary.md` documents the 120-entry Katakana pool, its exact
selection rules, additions, source comparisons, and kana coverage. It uses the
former Level 4 Katakana subset as the exam-oriented baseline, then adds a small
beginner layer cross-checked against Irodori and Marugoto A1 materials.

## JLPT N5 kanji inventory

`jlpt-n5-kanji.json` is a flat inventory of the exact 209-character curriculum
that Rikkyo University describes as equivalent to JLPT N5. The source ordering
and stages are retained: 73 `B6`, 68 `B5`, and 68 `B4` characters. This is a
coherent beginner curriculum, not an official JLPT specification; the JLPT has
not published an itemized kanji list since its 2010 revision.

Each entry has a stable Unicode-based `id`, one `character`, a concise English
`meaning`, its Rikkyo `stage`, and `onReadings` / `kunReadings` arrays. The exact
stage membership is stored in `source/rikkyo-n5-kanji.json`. Meanings and
Japanese readings are generated from current KANJIDIC2 data. When a standalone
core vocabulary entry exists, its learner-oriented meaning takes precedence.
Readings are limited to forms evidenced by the app's core vocabulary; a single
dictionary reading is retained as a fallback when the vocabulary has no usable
evidence. Readings use hiragana stems and are intentionally not exhaustive.
Irregular whole-word readings such as 今日（きょう）remain vocabulary data.

`kanji-contexts.json` contains a small set of complete example words for
characters that have no suitable context in the N5 core vocabulary. They make
all B6-B4 characters exercisable but remain separate from the vocabulary
curriculum and its SRS. French display meanings live in
`locales/fr/kanji-contexts.json`.

`source/vocabulary-examples.json` provides one short contextual sentence for
every core vocabulary item and kanji-only context. The prepared version adds
tokenization and furigana metadata, and is shown after both vocabulary and
kanji answers. French translations live in
`source/locales/fr/vocabulary-examples.json`.

Run `npm run kanji:update` to download current KANJIDIC2 data and regenerate the
flat inventory. For an already downloaded XML or XML.GZ file, run
`npm run kanji:update -- --source /path/to/kanjidic2.xml.gz`.

## Static lesson assets

Authored introduction and exercise data lives in `source/`. Lessons do not
contain local vocabulary lists, readings, or gloss maps. Run `npm run content`
after editing them. This tokenizes every sentence, searches the full dictionary,
narrows candidates by part of speech, and writes the discovered vocabulary IDs
into the browser-ready lesson and tokens. It also derives the unique curriculum
kanji IDs found in each sentence. At runtime, `app.js` obtains tooltip meanings
directly from `jlpt-n5-vocabulary.json` and Statistics metadata from
`jlpt-n5-kanji.json`.

Curated `inflections` supply exact surface readings. The optional
`allowPartOfSpeechMismatch` flag marks the rare form where Lindera assigns a
different part of speech; mismatch permission is never inferred for every
inflection.

If a surface form still has multiple compatible dictionary entries, the build
fails with all candidates. Add a `vocabularyOverrides` surface-to-ID mapping to
that source lesson only. Append an occurrence such as `#2` when repeated forms
need different meanings. Invalid, unused, and redundant overrides also fail so
temporary disambiguation does not accumulate unnoticed.

Use `tokenOverrides` for a category or reading correction that applies only to
one authored sentence. It uses the same surface and optional `#2` occurrence
keys as `vocabularyOverrides`. Invalid, unused, and redundant token overrides
fail content generation, keeping exceptions visible in lesson data rather than
accumulating phrase-specific branches in the tokenizer.

Run `npm run voices` to restore cached voices or generate any missing narration
through OpenAI. The generated WAV response is checked for silence and plausible
duration before it is compressed to mono AAC-LC in an M4A container. Available
M4A files under `assets/voices/grammar/` and `assets/voices/vocab/` are committed
with the application.
The API key is read only by this development command, from `OPENAI_API_KEY` or
`.key`; the browser app and static preview server do not read it or call OpenAI.

`npm run generate` prepares both the content and voices. `npm start` serves a
static local preview.
